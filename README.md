# Prework-Study-Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide to prepare me to become a full stack coder and an introduction before embarking down coding bootcamp. The study guide will give me notes to look back on while teaching me fundamentals of coding at the same time. I learn about HTML, CSS, Git and JavaScript. I learned how  to use the command line terminal and push changes through GitHub to have an online version of my work.
